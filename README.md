# MAIS202_Final_Project
Cross-Species Translation

Problem Statement: 
Animal communication is a complex system that humans have yet to fully understand. While some species exhibit structured vocalization patterns, interpreting their meanings remains a challenge. This project aims to bridge that gap by developing a Cross-Species Translation Model, which will analyze animal vocalizations and generate human-readable interpretations.
